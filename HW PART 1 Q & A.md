## How will you be working? What tools will help with that?

Frontend: 
We will use Figma to create wireframes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a modern 
frontend framework like React.js to build the user interface.

- Version Control: 
We will use Git and a platform like GitHub for collaborative development and version control.

- To ensure effective communication among our team members, we'll also be using collaboration tools such as Figma and Trello to manage our project. 
We will communicate and coordinate using messaging platforms like Slack and hold regular meetings to discuss progress and address any challenges and help each other where possible.

## How are you going to organise the workload? Who does what and when?

- To organise the workload efficiently, we will follow these steps:
Conduct a planning phase to outline the project requirements, define user needs, and identify the main features.

- Divide the project into smaller tasks and assign them to team members based on their strengths and (preferences).

- Set clear deadlines for each task and establish milestones to track progress.

- Regularly communicate through messaging platforms like Slack and Zoom and provide updates on individual tasks, seeking assistance or clarification when needed.

- Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.

- Regularly test and integrate individual components into a working system to identify and address any integration issues.

- Collaborate and support each other throughout the development process
